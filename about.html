          <p class="text-plain">We are a young team of professional who came out from enterprise companies. During our work we saw dozens of optimization points. One of these points is inputting information from paper. Cost optimization has always been the cornerstone of efficiency of any business, also in the era of digital technology, cost optimization has also become a factor of competition, since the winner is the one who can offer a lower price under the same conditions. Regardless of which segment you are working in - b2b or b2c - you are always faced with an enormous amount of contractors and partners (rent, delivery, commissions, services, reports, etc.), which is accompanied with a colossal workflow, often not even in digital, but paper format. And yet, these paper documents are later digitized and are included into your internal system, but that requires additional staff, costs, time and doesn’t even guarantee safety from the “human factor”, which may lead to even more expenses.Here is where we come in - with our new mobile application.</p>
